# Remindly

A minimalist, modern browser extension to help you stay mindful, hydrated, and centered during deep work or long office hours. Set gentle reminders for basic human needs—like fixing your posture, drinking water, or stretching—without breaking your focus.

## Overview

Remindly lets you set recurring reminders directly from your browser extension popup. Built with a sleek, Apple-like aesthetic using Svelte 5 and Tailwind CSS, it features smooth animations, derived state runes (`$state`, `$derived`), and an intuitive UI to toggle and manage intervals for different activities. The backend relies on Chrome Extension Service Workers, Chrome Storage API, and the Chrome Alarms API to deliver reliable browser notifications.

The project was inspired by the simple fact that when we get into "deep work" or long office hours, we often forget the basic things: drinking water, maintaining good posture, and taking a moment to stretch.

## The Story of Remindly

It was 3:00 PM on a Tuesday. Alex, a software engineer, had been staring at the same block of code since 10:00 AM. His spine had slowly morphed into the shape of a cooked shrimp. His coffee mug was a dry wasteland of brown rings, and his eyes felt like they were coated in sandpaper. 

Suddenly, a coworker tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey Alex, you okay? You look like a gargoyle defending a cathedral." 

Alex blinked, his neck cracking like a glowstick. He realized he hadn't taken a sip of water or moved his legs in five hours. He needed a hero. Not a cape-wearing, flying hero, but a tiny, polite hero that lived in his browser and gently whispered, *"Hey, buddy. Drink some water. And maybe un-shrimp your back."* 

Thus, Remindly was born. A tool to save us from ourselves during the treacherous depths of deep work.

### Key Directories Explained

**`/src/popup`** - The Svelte Frontend
- Contains the UI components that render when you click the extension icon.
- Built using modern Svelte 5 features (like `$state`, `$derived`, and `$effect`).
- Focuses on a buttery-smooth, accessible, and premium user experience.

**`/src/background`** - The Engine
- Contains `service-worker.ts`, the background script that runs persistently.
- Listens for changes in Chrome Storage.
- Schedules Chrome Alarms based on user intervals.
- Fires native Chrome Notifications when alarms trigger.

**`/src/stores`** - State Management
- `remainderStore.ts` acts as the bridge between the UI and Chrome Storage. It syncs the Reactivity of the UI with the persistent storage of the extension.

## Architecture & Principles

Remindly is built on a few core design and architectural principles:

### 1. Reactive Syncing (The Svelte 5 Way)
We heavily utilize Svelte 5's Runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) to keep the UI in sync. The `remainderStore.ts` creates a reactive state object that automatically saves to `chrome.storage.sync` whenever a value changes. This ensures that the state is never lost when the popup closes.

### 2. Ephemeral UI, Persistent Background
Chrome extension popups are ephemeral—they die the moment you click away. Therefore, no critical timer logic lives in the UI. 
- The **UI** just updates `chrome.storage`.
- The **Service Worker** listens to storage changes and schedules `chrome.alarms`.
- When an alarm fires, the Service Worker triggers a `chrome.notification`.
This guarantees that reminders trigger exactly on time, even if the popup is never opened again.

### 3. Accessible & Fluid Components
Custom components like `StepSlider.svelte` are built from scratch to allow smooth, elastic dragging mechanics while adhering to ARIA standards (e.g., `role="slider"`, `aria-valuenow`).

## How to Add New Reminders (For Developers)

Adding a new type of reminder (e.g., "Look away from the screen", "Take a deep breath") is straightforward!

### 1. Define the new ID
First, ensure your new reminder has a unique string identifier. For example: `"breathe"`.

### 2. Update the Store State Interface
If you want to track it, add a default state configuration in `src/stores/remainderStore.ts` or wherever you initialize your default storage object. 

*Example:*
```typescript
{
  id: "breathe",
  title: "Deep Breathing",
  description: "Take 3 deep breaths.",
  enabled: false,
  interval: 30, // minutes
  icon: "Wind" // Lucide icon name
}
```

### 3. Render a new Card in the UI
In `src/popup/pages/Popup.svelte`, map over your new state or manually add a `<RemainderCard>` component for your new reminder.

```svelte
<RemainderCard
  id="breathe"
  title="Deep Breaths"
  description="Inhale context, exhale bugs."
  bind:enabled={storeState.breathe.enabled}
  bind:interval={storeState.breathe.interval}
/>
```

### 4. The Background Script Handles the Rest
Because of the architecture, **you don't need to change the service worker**. The `service-worker.ts` dynamically listens to any changes in `chrome.storage`. As soon as your UI flips `enabled` to `true` and sets an `interval`, the background script will automatically create an alarm labeled `reminder-breathe` and fire notifications automatically!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm (recommended) or npm/yarn

### Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server (Vite + CRXJS will hot-reload your extension):
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. **Load the Extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
   - Click **Load unpacked**.
   - Select the `dist/` folder that was generated by the build step.

### Building for Production

Compile the extension for the Chrome Web Store:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
The optimized bundle will be neatly packaged in the `dist/` directory, ready to be zipped and uploaded.
